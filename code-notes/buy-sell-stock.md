## [Problem: Buy and sell stock - I](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/)
### Problem:
You are given the price of a stock for n days, i.e. an array 
of n (let's say) integers. 
You are allowed three operations on any given day: buy a stock, 
sell a stock or hold the stock. Initially, you start with no 
stocks. The objective is to buy a stock and then sell it 
(on a different day) so as to maximize the **profit**. 

#### Comments:
- We will actually go through a bunch of variants of this problem.
let's call the above version Variant 0.
- Some of the variants will be _natural_ and others will be _weird_
(kinda like generalization for generalization's sake :-)).
- we will indicate the time complexity. Also note that these are 
the thoughts for the pseudocode, and not the optimal (from pov 
of # of variables in the program to keep, etc.).
- _most_ of the variants below may be solved in _linear_ time, 
i.e. O(n) where n is the length of the array.
- for instance in Variant 0, in an actual program, we will 
need to keep just two running quantities through the program 
(say, _minimum_ and _difference_ or so.)

#### Note 
the idea of these code notes are to outline 
the approach to the problem and its variants. 
usually there will be memory
optimizations that will allow us to use only O(1) extra
memory, but we don't get into that part here.

### Variant 0:
Given an array A = [a_1, a_2, ..., a_n] find indices i and j with 
i < j so that the amount/profit a_j - a_i is _maximized_

#### Thoughts:
- given the optimal solution, a_i is surely the _minimum_ value 
among all the entries between [a_1, ..., a_j].
- similarly, a_j is the _maximum_ value between all the entries 
in [a_i, a_(i+1), ..., a_n]
- if not, we could have a better (i.e. higher) a_j - a_i value.
- **Components:** this naturally leads to the following subproblem:
    - for each i, compute the _minimum_ of the _prefix array_
    [a_1, a_2, ..., a_i]. Store results in a new array P 
    (for prefix).
    - for each j, compute the _maximum_ of the _suffix array_
    [a_j, a_(j+1), ..., a_n]. Store results in a new array S 
    (for suffix).
- **Stitching:** clearly if we have the two subproblems solved, then the original 
problem is easy:
    - for each index i, look at the entry P[i] and S[i+1] (while 
    observing obvious boundary conditions, etc.). The difference
    (between S[i+1] and P[i]) gives us a candidate.
    - max over all such candidates gives the answer. 
- good. can i solve the subproblem in O(n) time?
    - yes! For instance, for P: A sweep through the array while
    keeping on updating the minimum gives the answer. 
    - in formal terms, P[i] = min(P[i-1], a_i). either the minimum 
    corresponding to P[i] lies in the i_th term a_i or lies 
    before, i.e. is P[i-1]

### Variant 1:
Given _two_ arrays A = [a_1, ..., a_n] and B = [b_1, ..., b_n]
find indices i and j (where i < j) such that the amount b_j - a_i is maximized.

#### Thoughts:
- the only observation is that we really do not need much of a change
from Variant 0. 
- here, P will depend on A and S will depend on B.
- rest stays the same. 
- hey, it is not even necessary that A and B are the same length.
    - but of course, in that case, the time complexity is 
    O(max(len(A), len(B))).
    
### Variant 1a:
Given an array A = [a_1, ..., a_n], _functions_ f, g, 
find indices i and j (where i < j)
such that the amount f(a_j) - g(a_i) is maximized. 

#### Thoughts:
- easily maps to Variant 1. Given A, construct new arrays 
A_1 = [g(a_1), ... g(a_n)] and B = [f(a_1), ..., f(a_n)]
- in an actual program, of course we will not do this explicitly, 
and we will result in a O(n) algorithm.
- also, of course, nothing special about the _subtraction_ or 
_maximization_. we could as well be _minimizing_ (say)
f(a_j) + g(a_i)

### Variant 2 (two transactions)
Here, the problem setup is the same as above, but now we are 
allowed _two_ transactions where, at any point,
- we may either buy/hold/sell a stock, and
- we may hold on to at most 1 stock. 

#### Thoughts:
- if we were to plot the buy-sell sequences out by a timeline
of when we are holding the stock, then the timelines form 
intervals, and the intervals are _disjoint_. 
- given this problem, let's call the problem in Variant 0 as
 the **1-transaction** problem, and the current one as the 
 **2-transaction** one.
- notice how we solved Variant 0. applying similar decomposition 
ideas to this problem yields the following subproblems. 
- suppose the transactions (buy, sell, buy, sell) happen at 
 i_1, j_1, i_2, j_2 (with i_1 < j_1 < i_2 < j_2)
- then the solution i_1, j_1 is the optimal 1-transaction, i.e. 
Variant 0 solution to the subarray ending at i_2. 
- thus, it would help to consider the following subproblems:
    - for each i, compute the best 1-transaction for the prefix 
    subarray [a_1, a_2, ..., a_i]
    - similarly for each j, compute the best 1-transaction for the
    suffix subarray [a_j, a_(j+1), ..., a_n]
- given solutions to these subproblems, we can _stitch_ them up to 
get a solution to the 2-transactions case, overall time = O(n)
- so, how do we solve the subproblem in O(n) time?
    - similar to the sweeping solution for the subproblem in 
    Variant 0, let us try to work out a sweeping solution.
    - so we will maintain the max, min and the indices of the 
    prefix so far. 
    - let us call this new array of (max, min, indices) as Q;
    Q[i] contains the info about the corresponding prefix of
    the array. 
    - when we reach a[i], 
        - if a[i]> max: we have to update the max - min
        - if a[i] in (min, max): do nothing, no changes.
        - if a[i] < min: we have to set a[i] as the new min
        and this would start sort-of-a new epoch. no update to
         max can happen yet, and yet the max and min are out 
         of sequence. 
    - so overall, we realise 
        - we can make the above work out, with slightly more 
        effort, 
        - but still not clean enough.
    - this is where we remember the description of P[i] in terms
    of whether a[i] _participates_ in the minimum-finding or not.
    - so here too, lets branch on _participation_.
    - when we reach a[i]:
        - if a[i] participates in the max - min finding, then the
        solution would be a[i] - P[i-1] (where P[] stores the 
        prefix array of mins!)
        - if a[i] didn't participate, then the solution would be 
        available in Q[i-1]
        - so in short, Q[i] = max(a[i] - P[i-1], Q[i-1]) - imagining, 
        for now, that Q only contains the max 1-transaction value. 
    - and that is it - this solves Variant 2 in O(n) time.

### Interlude: 
- what i loved most about the problem above is the following idea: 
    - while Variant 1 indicates we can find the optimal 1-transaction for an 
array A in O(n) time, 
    - Variant 2 works off of the fact that we can in fact find the optimal 
    1-transactions for _every prefix_ of array A _still in O(n) time_!
- This is a very pretty feature of some problems, and is heavily used 
in various optimization algorithms.
- the interested reader may look up Megiddo's [parametric search](http://www.cs.uu.nl/research/techreps/repo/CS-2002/2002-050.pdf),
[parametric max flow](http://www3.math.tu-berlin.de/MDS/summerschool11-material/parametric_network_flow.pdf), 
etc. 

### Variant 3 (k transactions):
Same problem setup, but k transactions instead of 2. at any point, 
can hold on to at most one stock. 

#### Thoughts:
- given what we know so far, it is easy to see that this can 
also be framed as a dynamic program, and total time taken 
would be O(kn). 

### Variant 4 (arbitrary functions)
Given an array A = [a_1, a_2, ..., a_n] and k functions
f_1, f_2, ... f_k, find the 
max (f_1(a_(i_1)) + f_2(a_(i_2)) + ... + f_k(a_(i_k))) 
where i_1 < i_2 < ... < i_k. 

#### Thoughts:
- Like we moved from Variant 0 to Variant 1a, here too, we
can make the easy transition from Variant 2 to Variant 4. 
- a sample problem that we can solve using this Variant: 
given an array A = [a_1, a_2, ..., a_n] find max of 
a_(i_1) + a_(i_2) - a_(i_3) for three indices 
i_1 < i_2 < i_3. 
- note that Variant 3 with _k_ transactions actually corresponds
to (an instance of) Variant 4 with _2k_ functions.
- actually this very much relates to 
[Bellman's 1956 paper.](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/papers/2009/P869.pdf)
(will need to read this next.)

### Variant 5 (play with constraints on indices)
In this setup, we are 
- allowed 2 transactions,
- at most one transaction (buy/sell) at a time,
- but the transactions do not need to be _disjoint_, 
i.e. the sequence (buy, buy, sell, sell)
is _valid_. 

#### Thoughts
- While in Variant 2 (two transactions), the constraints on the 
indices are i_1 < j_1 < i_2 < j_2, here, the constraints are 
slightly relaxed: i_1 < j_1 and i_2 < j_2. 
- lets do the brute force way first
- constraints i_1 < j_1 and i_2 < j_2 is the union of two 
  **events**: 
    - i_1 < j_1 < i_2 < j_2 and 
    - i_1 < i_2 < j_1 < j_2
- we know how to find the max profit in the first of the above
situations. 
- do we know about the second situation? 
    - well, yes!
    - think in terms of Variant 4 above, where we are essentially
    maximizing - a(i_1) - a(i_2) + a(j_1) + a(j_2) with 
    these indices being in order. 
    - so for both of the **events** described above, we may 
    find the max profit in O(n)

### Variant 6 (different constraints on indices, k transactions)
the setup in Variant 5 with k transactions instead of just 2. 

#### Thoughts
- the trick applied for Variant 5 for 2 transactions will not 
scale because the number of **events** will blow up 
exponentially, giving us O(2^k n). 
- can we do better?

**To be contd.** This post has gone on long enough and 
starting with Variant 6 will be continued in a new post.
